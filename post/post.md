## Overview
"Journey to the center of The Library" takes place in an abandoned library. Since it was evacuated in 2025 monsters have moved in and have begun to call the library home. It is a dungeon crawler-styled game inspired by games such as labyrinth.

To create the game, I used Go, along with the [Ebitengine](https://ebitengine.org/) game library.

## How to play
Use the W/S/A/D keys to move your character around. Go through the different rooms in the library, picking up books in your trolley as you go through. Avoid monsters or kill them for points by running them over with your trolley or use your blast attack by pressing the SPACE key. You have a limited time to escape however you can gain more time by collecting clocks through the levels. Using your blast attack pushes your trolley away and eats up some of your remaining time so you try to reduce your use of it. Press SPACE to pick up your trolley again after it has been pushed away.

## What I would add with more time
1. Multiple different maps (floors in the library), with different themes, monsters, etc.
2. More monsters, like spiders or skeletons. 
3. Puzzles in some rooms that must be completed to continue.
